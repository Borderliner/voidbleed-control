const SnapshotRestoreHint = `A snapshot is a read-only copy of the root subvolume, kept on the same disk.

To get a file back, copy it out of the snapshot directory — it is an ordinary directory tree.

To roll the whole system back, the root subvolume has to be swapped while it is not mounted: boot the Voidbleed ISO, mount the top of the filesystem (mount -o subvolid=5 /dev/… /mnt), move @ aside, snapshot the one you want back into place as @, and reboot.

Snapshots share space with the filesystem they came from, and they are not a backup: a disk that fails takes them with it.`
